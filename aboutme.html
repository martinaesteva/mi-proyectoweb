        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Martina, an audiovisual designer with a strong interest in art direction, visual identity, and branding. Currently in my fourth year of Audiovisual Design and Illustration at UDIT Madrid, I bring together experiences from different creative fields to develop a sharp visual and strategic approach to communication.</p>

        <p>My background spans animation, illustration, and graphic design, which has allowed me to understand how images, sound, and storytelling connect. This multidisciplinary journey has shaped my ability to build cohesive visual concepts and translate them into strong identities and meaningful brand narratives.</p>

        <p>I am especially passionate about exploring how design can create impactful experiences that go beyond aesthetics, helping brands communicate authentically and connect with people.</p>

        <p>In this portfolio, you’ll find a selection of projects that reflect my style, skills, and approach to visual communication. Thank you for visiting!</p>
