      <h2>Out N About – Design and Mobile App Development Project</h2>
      <p>“Out N About” is a comprehensive project focused on the creation, design, and development of a mobile application centered around user experience. The app is designed to help users discover and receive personalized event recommendations based on their interests, gathered through an initial onboarding questionnaire.
Beyond tailored suggestions, the app allows users to book and manage event reservations directly. It also features a built-in social component where users can share photos, leave reviews, and recommend events they’ve attended—encouraging a collaborative and enriching social experience.
This project covers the entire UX/UI process, from user research and needs analysis to the design of intuitive interfaces and interactive prototypes that ensure a seamless and engaging experience.</p>
