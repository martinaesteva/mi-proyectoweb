      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m Martina, a passionate audiovisual designer and illustrator currently in my fourth year of the Audiovisual Design and Illustration’s degree at UDIT Madrid. My journey into design began at a young age when I discovered the power of storytelling through images and sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my studies, I’ve explored various disciplines, from animation and graphic design to digital illustration. I love combining traditional and digital techniques to create projects that capture attention and evoke emotions. I am particularly interested in visual narratives and how audiovisual elements can transform into immersive experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my academic formation, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several collaborative projects, where I’ve learned the importance of teamwork and shared creativity. I’m always open to new challenges and excited about continuing to learn and evolve in the design field.
