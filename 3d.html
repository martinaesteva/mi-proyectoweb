      <h2>3D Illustration</h2>
      <p>This 3D animation project, created using Cinema 4D, involved modeling, texturing, and animating various food items. Through precise movements and careful lighting, I was able to bring these elements to life, creating a visually striking experience that highlights my skills in 3D animation and digital design.</p>
